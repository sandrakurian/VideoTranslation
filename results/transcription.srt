1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,400
Now that we have created our trip, we are going to create a hotel expense line item.

2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,779
To do that, we're going to change our record type ID to hotel.

3
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,980
We're going to select our appropriate expansion option.

4
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:29,059
We're going to set our expense date to our last date of travel.

5
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,340
We're going to set our merchant name to the name of the hotel that we stayed at.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,859
Our total amount is going to be the amount we paid to the hotel as shown on our invoice.

7
00:00:49,839 --> 00:00:54,619
Our check-in date is going to be the date we checked into the hotel.

8
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:01,840
And our check-out date is going to be the date we checked out of the hotel.

9
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:12,620
State Sponsored event, we say yes or no as to whether the event we attended was in fact state sponsored.

10
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:22,260
Our night over state limit, we say yes or no as to whether or not the nightly room rate,

11
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,819
which is the room rate itself is more than 225 a night.

12
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:37,739
And then we identify whether or not the expense was paid by personal payment, which is out of pocket.

13
00:01:38,739 --> 00:01:48,859
Whether or not it was paid by state issued P card or whether or not it was paid by MFMP AOD purchase order.

14
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,980
And then we hit save.

15
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:00,219
And now we have created a hotel expense line item.
